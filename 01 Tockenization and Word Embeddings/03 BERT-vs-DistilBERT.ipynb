    "# Differences Between BERT and DistilBERT\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT and DistilBERT are both transformer-based models designed for natural language processing tasks, but there are key differences in architecture, size, efficiency, and deployment considerations. Understanding these differences helps choose the right model for a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture and Model Size\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT-base has a standard transformer architecture with 12 encoder layers (transformer layers), 12 attention heads, and a hidden size of 768. This results in approximately **110 million parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "DistilBERT is a compressed version of BERT. It uses only **6 transformer layers**, retains 12 attention heads, and maintains a hidden size of 768, resulting in approximately **66 million parameters**, which is roughly **40% smaller** than BERT-base.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduction in layers is achieved by removing every second layer from the original BERT architecture while retaining most of the model's representational power.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of its smaller size, DistilBERT offers significant efficiency improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster inference:** About 60% faster than BERT-base due to fewer layers.\n",
    "- **Lower memory consumption:** Requires less RAM during training and inference, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources, such as mobile phones or edge devices.\n",
    "- **Smaller model size:** Easier to store and distribute without losing much accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT-base, on the other hand, requires more computational resources and longer training and inference times due to its larger number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Trade-Off\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being smaller and faster, DistilBERT retains approximately **97% of BERT’s performance** on a wide range of NLP tasks. This means the trade-off in accuracy is minimal, while the gains in speed and resource efficiency are substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For most NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and labeling, **DistilBERT is sufficient**.\n",
    "- BERT-base is only necessary for specialized tasks that may require the full depth of 12 transformer layers, such as highly domain-specific tasks in medical or scientific text.\n",
    "\n",
